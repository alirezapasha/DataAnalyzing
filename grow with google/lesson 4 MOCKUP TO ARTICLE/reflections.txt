Your response goes here!
First skill that I learned is how to write html codes in organize. It would be an important key for me to do in the same way that professional coders do. Also  I learned new tags like <strike> and <sup> that I didn't know. Also I learned I must search when I want to use new tag or I need new feature that I don't know about it. It is easy when you consider it as a game and hobby;) I prefer to enjoy of being a developer. With this useful course nothing is difficult. All of the tasks are easy and fun. I solved my problem by dividing them and then conqure of them. It is easy way to finish even a big problem or project.
Thanks
